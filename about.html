    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>I made this website as a hobby site, meant for nothing but a portfolio kind of personal webpage.<br>That is until i wrote my first tech-tutorial on this site, and decided to make it a Blog,<br>Maybe it's because i enjoyed writing things (to others). While i do plan on revealing my true identity to the internet, maybe in the future,<br>as of now, It's a personal blog site without an identifiable owner.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hey! you can call me Pigeon! <br> I'm a retro-tech-enthusiast who's also intrested in free/open-source software,<br>and I'm very nostalgic for the 2000s technology (websites.. videogames.. hardware.. software... you name it).<br>My hobbies include badminton, reading books, cycling, "fiddling around with linux" and playing video games (sometimes).<br>The pigeon as you can see from my website, is an "online-identity" that i use, probably the first one i ever used,<br>because of the fact that i lived during the time of  <i>"the rise of facebook"</i> which promoted real life identities and Highly discouraged anonymity.<br>Anyways, i plan on keeping this site up as long as i plan to "hide" under this online identity and then maybe later re-brand it to something else without removing any content.<br>Also, I chose this name(pigeon) for no apparent reason, I just randomly chose to use the username "The-Pigeon-God" when i first started using discord (a chat application),<br>in which my  friends were all named anonymously and suggested me to do the same, The username is still close to me as it ever was :)</p>
