    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>I made this website as a hobby site, meant for nothing but a "portfolio kind of personal webpage". That is until i wrote my first "tech-tutorial" on this site, and decided to make it an Anonymous Blog, Maybe because i enjoyed writing things to others. I then removed my real-name, face and some other info. While i do plan on revealing my identity to the internet maybe in the future, as of now It's a personal blog page waiting for it's owner to reveal itself.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a "retro-tech-enthusiast who also likes free/open-source software, and I'm very nostalgic for the 2000s technology (websites.. videogames.. software... you name it). My hobbies include badminton, reading books, cycling, "fiddling around with linux" and playing video games(rarely). The pigeon as you can see from my website, is an "online-identity" that i use, probably the first one i have ever used, since i lived during the time of  <i>the rise of facebook</i>  which promoted real life identities and Highly discouraged anonymity :(. Anyways, i plan on keeping this site up as long as i plan to "hide" under this online identity and then later Re-brand it to something else without removing any content. Also,  I chose this name(pigeon) for no apparent reason, I just randomly chose to use the username "The-Pigeon-God" when i first started using discord(a chat application), and my friends were all named anonymously and suggested me to do the same, The username is still close to me as it ever was :)</p>
